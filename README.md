Predicting Cuisines of Recipes

## Description
Given a list of ingredients in a recipe, predict what type of cuisine it is from (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.)

## Task
This data set could be used for clustering (group together similar recipes) or collaborative filtering (given a partial recipe, suggest other ingredients that could go along with it). The supervised cuisine prediction task is perhaps too easy, but these other tasks could be more interesting. It is also easy to get many additional recipes from the internet to build a larger data set, which might make collaborative filtering, etc., easier.
